Project Summary

Our project focuses on optimizing transportation and logistics operations, particularly in the context of platooning and efficient route management. Utilizing advanced optimization techniques with Gurobi and Python's powerful data handling capabilities, the project aims to minimize transportation costs and enhance operational efficiency. Key aspects include optimizing platooning strategies, managing waiting times, and integrating new motorway developments into logistics planning. The project leverages complex datasets, implements optimization models, and produces detailed analyses for strategic decision-making.

Empty Milage for Platooning

Script is designed to optimize empty mileage in a platooning context. It reads various cost and flow datasets, sets up the model with decision variables, and implements constraints to optimize the platooning routes. The script minimizes the total cost associated with empty mileage in platooning operations. Data import and handling from Excel, setup and configuration of the optimization model, minimizing empty mileage in platooning, and decision variables and constraint handling are its main features.

Tırport Platooning Project January 12

Script focuses on optimizing the Tırport platooning project, considering specific operational constraints and route optimizations. It includes complex data manipulations, cost calculations, and the application of decision variables to optimize the platooning strategy for efficiency. Advanced data processing and optimization for platooning, route optimization in the context of logistics and transportation, cost calculation and minimization strategies, and detailed output analysis for platooning optimization are the key aspects of this script.

Tırport Platooning Project With New Motorway

Building on the platooning project, this script incorporates the impact of new motorway developments on platooning strategies. It adjusts the optimization model to account for new routes and conditions, offering insights into how new infrastructure affects platooning efficiency. Incorporation of new motorway data into the platooning model, adaptation of route optimization strategies to new infrastructure, cost and efficiency analysis with the updated transportation network, and strategic insights into infrastructure impact on logistics are its main features.

Waiting Times Optimization

Script is dedicated to optimizing waiting times in transportation and logistics operations. It focuses on minimizing idle times, enhancing efficiency, and improving overall operational flow by optimizing schedule and route planning. Optimization of waiting times in logistics operations, improvement of operational efficiency and schedule management, reduction of idle time through strategic route planning, and enhanced decision-making for logistics and transportation scheduling are the key aspects of this script.
